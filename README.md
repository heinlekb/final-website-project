## Kendall's Final Project

## Pages
    1) About Me Page
    The About Me Page is my first page of my website and can be accessed
    when clicking on the "about me" in the top right in the navigation bar. This page gives a little bit of insight of who I am. I want the user to open my website and be able to get to know a little bit about me. I also want the user to feel welcomed when entering my website.
    2) Designs Page
    The Deisngs Page can be accessed by clicking on "designs" in the top
    right of my website in the navigation bar. My designs page show cases
    a couple of my adobe works that I have made while using mostly illustrator and photoshop. This page is for the user to see my experience
    with digital art and what I have created in the past year.
    3) Contact Page
    The Contact Page can be found when clicking on "contact" at the top right
    of my website in the navigation bar. The contact page is there so that 
    the user can send me a personal message.
    4) Resume Page
    The Resume Page can be accessed when clicking on "resume" in the top right of my website in the navigation bar. This page allows the user
    to be able to get to know me and view my experience.

    Overall, I want my website to allow users to access a portfolio about myself. I want the user to learn about my experiences and skills in digital art as well as learning about myself.
